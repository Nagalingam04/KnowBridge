ðŸ¤– AI Knowledge Agent (n8n Workflow)

This project is an n8n workflow that transforms documents and YouTube videos into a searchable knowledge base. It automatically extracts text from documents and fetches transcripts from YouTube links, allowing users to ask natural language questions and receive context-aware answers powered by LLMs.

âš¡ Modular, simple, and extendable â€” import the workflow into n8n, connect your API keys and vector database, and start querying your own knowledge sources.

âš¡ Note: The workflow does not include credentials. You must configure and use your own API keys (LLM, vector database, etc.) inside n8nâ€™s Credentials Manager.
